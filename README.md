# Vibrational-Spectroscopy-of-Organic-Molecules
Simulates the vibrational spectra of organic molecules such as amino acids, peptides, or nucleic acids using PyVib2's vibrational perturbation theory algorithm with a DFT potential energy surface. Analyzes the vibrational spectra and investigates the effects of different functional groups and conformations.
